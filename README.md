# StackOverFlow-Lite
This is a project that enhances research, sharing and learning. 
This is achieved by the ability of the platform to provide users with an interactive sharing platform.
As of the moment, the UI templates are complete and the next stage is to make them more functional to the user.

The platform once complete will have three main parts: the initial pages (Login and Signup), the dashboard for navigation and user interaction pages (profile and questions pages).

# Project Breakdown:

# Sgnup: 
Allows a new user to create an account

# Login: 
An already registered user can access the dashboard and navigate

# Dashboard: 
Provides user interaction by allowing them to access their profile and questions.

# Profile: 
Allows the user to post a new question, provides the user with the questions that they have already asked, the answers to the questions and a sorting option for the questions with the most answers.

# Questions: 
User is able to view all the questions that have already been asked, select a question to view its answers and can post a question.
